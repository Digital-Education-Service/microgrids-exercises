# Exercises and Examples for course Renewable Energy: Sustainable Electricity Supply with Microgrids

This repository contains the data and links required to run the PyEPLAN exercises for the FutureLearn course [Renewable Energy: Sustainable Electricity Supply with Microgrids](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/renewable-energy-sustainable-electricity-supply-with-microgrids).

To execute the exercises, there are two options, using the cloud platform Google Colab or downloading from GitHub and running locally on your personal computer.

## Using Google Colab

You will need a Google account and be signed in to be able to do the exercise. To access the exercise, open the ‘Launch in Google Colab’ link provided below in any browser and sign into your Google account when prompted.

The examples are prepared in the form of a notebook and you can read through them like a report.

2. [5 bus planning example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Digital-Education-Service/microgrids-exercises/blob/main/Google-Colab-files/5_bus_MG_Planning_Example_COLAB.ipynb)
3. [Watoto Village case study](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Digital-Education-Service/microgrids-exercises/blob/main/Google-Colab-files/Watoto_Village_Case_Study_COLAB.ipynb)

## Downloading to your machine

If you do not have access to a Google account or do not wish to set one up, you can download the files required for the exercise and run them locally on your computer. Instructions on how to do this are provided below. This approach to the exercise requires a more advanced technical knowledge and dependent programs to be installed.

1. You will first need to [install PyEPLAN](https://pyeplan.sps-lab.org/get_started/installation.html)
2. You will also need to [install Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install). Please note that a pre-requisite to this is have have both Python and pip installed on your machine.
3. Download the entire repository on your personal computer by selecting the '**Code**' button at the top of the files list and selecting '**Download ZIP**'.
4. Extract all files from the ZIP once the download has finished.
5. Open the terminal/command prompt for your machine and `cd` to the location of the repository download (this is likely to be `cd Downloads/microgrids-exercises-main`).
6. Launch Jupyter Notebooks by entering `jupyter notebook` in the terminal/command prompt and then selecting enter.
7. This will launch the files in your browser and you will be able to then open the specific Jupyter Notebook file you need for your exercise (located in the `Jupyter-Notebook-files` folder).
8. There are three similar exercises throughout the course so ensure you are opening the relevant notebook for the step you are on in the course.
9. Once the notebook is open, you can work through it as instructed in the notebook itself.
